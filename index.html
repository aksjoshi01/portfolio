      <h2>Profile</h2>
      <p>
        I am a Master's student at Carnegie Mellon University, specializing in Computer Systems and Networking. My passion lies in building efficient, scalable, and robust solutions in systems and network engineering. I have hands-on experience implementing custom TCP features over UDP, developing dynamic memory allocators, and building Linux-based command-line shells, which demonstrate my skills in concurrency, performance optimization, and low-level programming. My work also extends to simulating dynamic networks and analyzing routing protocols, reflecting my interest in both the theoretical and practical aspects of networking.
      </p>
      <p>
        My technical toolkit includes C/C++, Go, Python, Java, CUDA, OpenMP, MPI, and a deep familiarity with Linux, networking stacks, and performance engineering. I am eager to explore roles in system software engineering, network engineering, or data center networking, where I can contribute to building the next generation of computing infrastructure.
