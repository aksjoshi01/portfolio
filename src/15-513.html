            <h2>15-513: Introduction to Computer Systems</h2>

            <h3>1. Dynamic Memory Allocator</h3>

            <p>
                The Dynamic Memory Allocator project for 15-513 focused on designing a custom heap manager that
                implements <code>malloc</code>, <code>free</code>, <code>realloc</code>, and <code>calloc</code>
                operations efficiently to support varied allocation sizes and patterns.
            </p>
            <p>
                To minimize fragmentation and accelerate block selection, the allocator uses <em>segregated free
                    lists</em> that categorize free blocks into multiple size classes, enabling near-constant-time
                best-fit searches within the smallest suitable list.
            </p>
            <p>
                Small-size classes up to 96 bytes are grouped in 16 byte increments, and dedicated “mini blocks” of 32
                bytes eliminate footer overhead, boosting memory utilization for tiny allocations.
            </p>
            <p>
                On each allocation request, the size is rounded up to 16 byte alignment; the allocator probes the
                corresponding free list using a best-fit policy to minimize leftover space. If no block fits, the heap
                is extended by 4 KB and large remainders are split and reinserted into their appropriate lists.
            </p>
            <p>
                When freeing memory, blocks are immediately coalesced with adjacent free neighbors to reduce external
                fragmentation and then returned to the correct segregated list for rapid reuse.
            </p>
            <p>
                Benchmarking with the standard <code>mdriver</code> suite demonstrated an average memory utilization of
                74.4% and throughput up to 12,800 kilo-operations per second on a 3.0 GHz CPU, outperforming naive
                first-fit and next-fit allocators.
            </p>
            <p>
                A comprehensive heap checker validated invariants—such as correct header/footer pairing, alignment
                guarantees, and proper coalescing—ensuring robustness under diverse workloads.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Tiny Linux Shell</h3>

            <p>
                The Tiny Linux Shell implements a minimal Unix command interpreter with support for both built-in and
                external commands, providing job control semantics similar to standard shells. It enables users to
                manage foreground and background jobs, respond to signals such as Ctrl-C and Ctrl-Z,
                and prevent zombie processes by correctly reaping child processes.
            </p>

            <p>
                Upon startup, the shell configures prompt display and installs signal handlers for SIGINT, SIGTSTP,
                SIGCHLD, SIGTTIN, and SIGTTOU to manage job control reliably. The core of the shell is a read–eval
                loop that prints a prompt, reads a line from stdin, parses it into
                tokens, and dispatches either a built-in function or forks a child process to execute an external
                program.
            </p>

            <p>
                Built-in commands (`quit`, `jobs`, `bg`, `fg`) execute within the shell process and manipulate an
                internal linked list job table that tracks job IDs, PIDs, and states (foreground, background,
                stopped). The `jobs` command lists all active jobs, while `bg` and `fg` resume stopped jobs in
                background or
                foreground by sending SIGCONT to the appropriate process group.
            </p>

            <p>
                Non-built-in commands are executed by forking a child process, placing it in its own process group, and
                invoking `execve` to load the desired executable. Input and output redirection is supported by
                opening specified files and duplicating file descriptors
                via `dup2()` before `execve`, ensuring the child’s stdin and stdout are correctly routed[7].
            </p>

            <p>
                A SIGCHLD handler reaps terminated or stopped children using `waitpid` with `WNOHANG|WUNTRACED`,
                updating job states and avoiding zombie processes. SIGINT and SIGTSTP handlers forward interrupts and
                stop signals to the foreground job’s process group,
                allowing the shell itself to remain responsive. Critical sections that modify the job list are
                protected by blocking all signals with `sigprocmask` to
                prevent race conditions between the main loop and asynchronous handlers.
